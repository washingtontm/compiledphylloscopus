Very flimsy and was compacted together so couldn’t distinguish between the cups very well. But there are some patterns from other troichloides nest that I am able to differeientiate  between three different cups. The weight of these cups may be off. Cup 1 is made from predominantly loosly interwoven moss with a few pine straws and thick course white hair sprinkled throughout the cup. Also, there are clumps of dead wispy like grass throughout cup 1. Cup 2 was seperable bedue to the interwovenness of the moss. It was much more tightly packed tighlty interwoven with each  other with very few pieces of dead grass and more thick course short white hair than in cup 1. Cup 3 is superable because there is smaller pieces of moss and softer and more white course thick short hair and short/small pieces of dead grass interwoven together with this sawdust like dirt matting it all together. There are few pieces of moss but not as much as cup 1 and 2. ",NA,3,NA,NA,8.5,1,30,,2.5,1,45,NA,NA,3.8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,y,y,NA,NA,y,n,n

Once dried-- Cup 1 is made from mainly moss and dead leaves and more pine than dead grass interwoven. A few hairs interwoven within cup 1. This nest was very hard to deconstruct with no clear cups. Cup 3 where the chicks lay i am assuming is the softer and smaller pieces of moss that is clearly different than cup 1. Cup 3 is made from mainly moss with a few dead grass and thick course white hair as well. . For this nest, I will say there are 2 cups because not entirely sure there are 3 cups because it was not easily sepreable. There is more pine and straw currounding cup 3 but was unable to seperate from the moss from cup 1.

Cup 1 is primarily made from moss and dead grass. Cup 2 is seperable because the moss is softer and more tightly woven together.  Also with dead grass. Cup 3 is very tightly woven together and mainly made from soft moss. Cup 3 contains a few pieces of grass and hair. With this nest, the cups are defined by how tightly woven the nests are. All three cups contain moss. Barely any hair in cup 3. ",NA,3,NA,NA,10.8,2.8,65,250.7142857,6.8,1.8,90,340,2.153846154,3.8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,y,y,NA,NA,y,n,n

Once dried-- Cup 1 is almost entirely made from moss including the surroundings and the bottom. A few pine and hair is interwoven with the moss. Overall, very flimsy nest and easily flattened. This was a messy deconstruction, because it was flattened and it was hard to seperate the three different cups. There are 3 cups and this is noticble by the change in composition in cup 1 to 2 from mainly moss to mainly dead grass. Cup 3 is made from mainly moss and thin dead grass matted together. The seperation of cups are apparant visually. Cup 1 moss is loose and not tightly woven together. Cup 3 moss is matted together and almost inseperable.
